Welcome to the new site for allsbe.  Live on git hub.  

Git is an amazing framework, so is Jekyll, really happy to have found this.  It seemed natural to want to move the Jekyll code to an openshift account to experiment, and I valiantly tried to set Jekyll up from scratch there, hoping to extend and expand on the basics there, but it was nearly impossible.  Not sure if I am doing something wrong, or if Openshift is really that difficult to work with.  Once installing a Ruby app, I tried to use bundle and Gemfiles to get Jekyll running, but it refused to install properly, on either the 2.0 or 1.93 versions of Ruby in openshift.  Openshift seems like a great place to try new things, if anyone has any pointers on setting up Jekyll **from scratch** there let me know, I would really appreciate any tips/guidance.  I know there are already cartridges there for Jekyll, but that kind of takes the fun out of learning something new.
